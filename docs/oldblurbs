Computer science is the study of information processes.  Computer
scientists study how to describe, predict properties of, and efficiently
implement information processes.  <!--When confronted with a problem,
computer scientists do not just attempt to solve it.  Instead, they
think about a problem as a mapping between its inputs and desired
outputs, develop a systematic sequence of steps for solving the problem
for any possible input, and consider how the number of steps required to
solve the problem scales as the input size increases.  Thinking about
problems this way has practical value since it leads to programs
computers can execute to solve problems remarkably quickly, but also
impacts the way we think about defining and solving problems regardless
of whether or not a computer is involved.

This book introduces the most important ideas in computing.  It focuses
on how to describe information processes by defining procedures, how to
analyze the costs required to carry out a procedure, and the fundamental
limits of what can and cannot be computed mechanically.
