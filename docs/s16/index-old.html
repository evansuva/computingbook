<b>cs1120 Spring 2016</b>
<p>
<b>Course Objective.</b> The goal of this course is to teach students with no
prior experience in computing to think like computer scientists.
</p><p>
The course is designed to enable students to appreciate, use and
understand ideas at the core of computer science. This is the first
course in the BA Computer Science major, but the course covers ideas
that will be useful and interesting to students, whether or not they
major in computer science.  This course satisfies the prerequisite for
cs2110 and cs2220, as well as for the BACS major.
</p>

<p><b>Expected Background:</b> This course is open to students with no
  prior background in computer science or programming.  </p>
<p>
The only background we assume is: </p>
<ul>
<li> Language: reasonable proficiency in reading and writing English
<li> Math: understanding of whole numbers and addition, subtraction,
  multiplication, divison and exponentiation.
<li> Logic: familiarity with logicial <em>and</em> and <em>or</em>
  and <em>not</em>.
<li> Computer Literacy: ability to use email and browse the web.
</ul>
</p>
<p>

<b>Books:</b> The coursebook
    is <a href="http://www.computingbook.org"><em>Introduction to
    Computing: Explorations in Language, Logic, and Machines</em></a> by
    David Evans.  You can download the book
    from <a href="http://www.computingbook.org"><em>http://www.computingbook.org</em></a>
    and print it yourself
    or <a href="http://www.computingbook.org/printed.html">order a
    printed copy</a>.  </p>
<p>
There may be some revisions done to the coursebook during the semester,
and some additional readings in the course from other sources.

</p>


<b>Meetings:</b> Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, 1:00-1:50PM in
